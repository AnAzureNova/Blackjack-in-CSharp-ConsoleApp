# Blackjack in C# Console App
Simple blackjack entirely made in C# Console App. An old project of mine i made to practice c#. Probably incredibly basic and horrible, but it exists. Download of the first and most probably final version can be found in <a href="https://github.com/AnAzureNova/Blackjack-in-CSharp-ConsoleApp/releases/tag/bjackv1" ref="_target"><b>RELEASE (V1.0)</b></a>
> I wont update this any time in the future. This is a side practice project and solely a reupload.
